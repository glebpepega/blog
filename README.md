# pepega blog
Pepega blog is a blog-website, that can register users, authenticate users with cookies, lets users create their own blogs and make posts! Also if you want, you can always find other people's pages and check them out too.

I wrote minimalistic HTML front-end, implemented data storage with Postgres and made API communication possible with HTML forms and golang core libraries.
